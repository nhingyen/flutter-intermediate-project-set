# ðŸ“š Project 2: Todo App (Local State)

This is a simple to-do list application built with Flutter. The primary goal of this project is to practice managing local state using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()`.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Add** new tasks via an `AlertDialog`.
- **Complete** tasks by tapping a checkbox, which toggles a `lineThrough` text style.
- **Delete** tasks from the list.

## ðŸš€ Core Concepts Demonstrated

- **`StatefulWidget`:** Used to hold and manage the list of tasks.
- **`setState()`:** Called whenever a task is added, toggled, or deleted to rebuild the UI with the new state.
- **`ListView.builder()`:** Efficiently displays the scrollable list of tasks.
